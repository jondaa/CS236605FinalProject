# CS236605FinalProject

## Final Project from CS236605 - Deep Learning on Computational Accelerators

This was the final course project for the aformentioned course I took in Winter 2018/2019 at the Technion, together with Shay Avital.

This project uses the idea of Variance Layers, as proposed in Variance Networks: When Expectation Does Not Meet Your Expectations (https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.03764), and extends it to a variation of discrete distributions. 
We explore various discretized distributions formed from the normal and uniform distributions.

The layers are adapted from the code provided by the authors of the paper on their github repository.

The implementation is in Python using Pytorch, and presented in a Jupyter Notebook.
